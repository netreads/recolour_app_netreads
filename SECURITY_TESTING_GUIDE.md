## Troubleshooting

### If Right-Click Still Works:
- Check if `SecurityProtection` component is mounted
- Verify `onContextMenu` handlers are attached
- Check browser console for errors

### If DevTools Open:
- Some browsers allow DevTools via menu (expected)
- Check if keyboard shortcuts are blocked (main goal)
- Verify `SecurityProtection` is active

### If URL Is Exposed:
- Check `/api/preview-image` endpoint
- Verify payment status check
- Ensure canvas rendering is used
- Check if `isPaid` flag is correct

### If Watermarks Missing:
- Check `SecureImagePreview` component is used
- Verify canvas rendering completes
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure image loads successfully

## Known Acceptable Limitations

These are expected and acceptable:
- ‚úÖ DevTools can still be opened via browser menu
- ‚úÖ Screenshots can be taken (but are watermarked)
- ‚úÖ Screen recording is possible (but watermarked)
- ‚úÖ Very technical users might extract canvas data (but it's watermarked)

**Why Acceptable:**
- Watermarks make extracted images less valuable
- Low price point (‚Çπ49) makes bypassing not worthwhile
- Perfect security is impossible; we aim for "secure enough"
- Most users will simply pay rather than attempt bypass
