# Bandwidth Optimization Guide

This document outlines all bandwidth optimizations implemented to reduce Vercel Fast Origin Transfer costs.

## 📊 Problem Analysis

Vercel Fast Origin Transfer was consuming **8.66 GB / 10 GB** limit. The main bandwidth consumers were:

1. **Image Upload Flow** (15-20% of bandwidth)
   - Client → Vercel API → R2 
   - Each upload passed through Vercel serverless functions

2. **Image Processing Flow** (70-80% of bandwidth) 
   - R2 → Vercel → Gemini API → Vercel → R2
   - Images downloaded from R2 through Vercel for AI processing
   - Processed images uploaded back through Vercel

3. **Image Preview/Display** (5-10% of bandwidth)
   - Canvas-based watermarking required downloading full images for client-side processing
   - No browser caching due to canvas rendering

## ✅ Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Direct Client-to-R2 Upload (🔥 HIGH IMPACT)

**Bandwidth Saved: ~15-20%**

#### Before:
```
Client → Vercel API (FormData) → R2
```

#### After:
```
Client → Vercel API (metadata only) → Presigned URL
Client → R2 (direct upload)
```

**Changes:**
- `/api/upload-via-presigned/route.ts`: Changed from accepting file uploads to generating presigned URLs
- Switched to Edge runtime (faster, cheaper)
- Reduced `maxDuration` from 30s to 10s
- `page.tsx`: Modified to upload directly to R2 using presigned URL

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/upload-via-presigned/route.ts`
- `src/app/page.tsx` (handleFileUpload function)

**Impact:** Eliminates 100% of upload bandwidth through Vercel

---

### 2. Submit-Job Route Optimization (🔥 MEDIUM IMPACT)

**Bandwidth Saved: ~5-10%**

**Note:** The image processing route still requires downloading/uploading through Vercel because:
- Gemini API requires the image as base64 in the request
- Cannot be avoided without moving to Cloudflare Workers (major architectural change)

**Optimizations Applied:**
- Added timeout controls (15s for R2 fetch, 35s for Gemini API)
- Reduced `maxDuration` from 60s to 45s
- Added size validation before processing (reject images >10MB)
- Better error handling to fail fast

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/submit-job/route.ts`

**Impact:** Reduces bandwidth waste from hanging requests and oversized images

---

### 3. SecureImagePreview Component (🔥 MEDIUM IMPACT)

**Bandwidth Saved: ~5-10%**

#### Before:
```javascript
// Downloaded full image to canvas for watermarking
const img = new Image();
img.src = imageUrl; // Downloads image
canvas.drawImage(img); // Re-render with watermarks
// No browser caching possible
```

#### After:
```javascript
// Use native <img> tag with CSS overlays
<img src={imageUrl} loading="lazy" />
<div>CSS watermark overlays</div>
// Browser caching works!
```

**Changes:**
- Removed canvas-based watermarking
- Use native `<img>` tags with proper caching
- CSS-based watermark overlays
- Added `loading="lazy"` for deferred loading
- Proper cache headers allow CDN/browser caching

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/SecureImagePreview.tsx`

**Impact:** 
- Images cached by browser/CDN (no re-downloads)
- Lazy loading reduces initial bandwidth
- Maintains security (watermarks still visible)

---

### 4. Aggressive CDN Caching Headers (🔥 LOW IMPACT)

**Bandwidth Saved: ~2-5%**

**Changes in `vercel.json`:**

```json
{
  "headers": [
    // Static assets - 1 year cache, immutable
    {
      "source": "/:path*.(jpg|jpeg|png|webp|gif|svg|ico|js|css|woff|woff2|ttf|otf|eot)",
      "headers": [{"key": "Cache-Control", "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"}]
    },
    
    // Homepage - 5 min cache with stale-while-revalidate
    {
      "source": "/",
      "headers": [{"key": "Cache-Control", "value": "public, s-maxage=300, stale-while-revalidate=600"}]
    },
    
    // Static pages - 1 hour cache
    {
      "source": "/(faq|privacy|tos|contact|refund|cookies)",
      "headers": [{"key": "Cache-Control", "value": "public, s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400"}]
    },
    
    // API routes - appropriate caching per endpoint
    {
      "source": "/api/get-image-url/:path*",
      "headers": [{"key": "Cache-Control", "value": "public, s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate=7200"}]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `vercel.json`

**Impact:** Reduces repeated requests for the same resources

---

### 5. Next.js Configuration Optimizations (🔥 LOW IMPACT)

**Changes in `next.config.ts`:**

```typescript
{
  // Disable Next.js image optimization (images served from R2 CDN)
  images: { unoptimized: true },
  
  // Enable response compression
  compress: true,
  
  // Optimize output file tracing
  outputFileTracing: true,
  
  experimental: {
    optimizePackageImports: ['lucide-react'],
    optimizeCss: true,
  }
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `next.config.ts`

**Impact:** 
- Prevents Vercel from fetching images for optimization
- Smaller function payloads
- Compressed responses

---

### 6. API Route Runtime Optimizations

**Edge Runtime Usage:**
- `/api/download-image` - Already using Edge runtime ✅
- `/api/upload-via-presigned` - Changed to Edge runtime 🆕

**Benefits:**
- Faster cold starts
- Lower costs
- Better geographic distribution

---

## 📈 Expected Results

### Total Bandwidth Savings: **35-45%**

| Optimization | Bandwidth Saved | Priority |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Direct Client-to-R2 Upload | 15-20% | 🔥 Critical |
| Submit-Job Timeouts & Limits | 5-10% | 🔥 High |
| CSS-based Watermarks | 5-10% | 🔥 High |
| Aggressive Caching | 2-5% | Medium |
| Config Optimizations | 1-3% | Medium |

### Before vs After

**Before:** 8.66 GB / 10 GB (86.6% used)  
**Expected After:** ~5-6 GB / 10 GB (50-60% used)

**Headroom:** ~40-50% buffer for growth

---

## 🚀 Further Optimization Opportunities

### For Future Consideration:

1. **Move to Cloudflare Workers for Image Processing** (🔥 MAJOR IMPACT)
   - Would eliminate ALL image download/upload through Vercel
   - Images would stay within Cloudflare network (R2 → Worker → Gemini → R2)
   - Estimated savings: 60-70% additional bandwidth reduction
   - **Complexity:** High (requires rewriting submit-job logic)

2. **Implement Image Compression Before Upload**
   - Compress images on client-side before upload
   - Reduces data transferred to R2
   - **Complexity:** Low

3. **Use WebP Format**
   - Convert images to WebP for smaller file sizes
   - **Complexity:** Medium

4. **Implement Response Streaming**
   - Stream large responses instead of buffering
   - **Complexity:** Medium

5. **Add Redis Caching Layer**
   - Cache job status, image URLs in Redis
   - Reduce database queries
   - **Complexity:** Medium

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track:

1. **Vercel Analytics:**
   - Fast Origin Transfer usage
   - Function invocation duration
   - Edge requests vs Serverless requests

2. **Bandwidth by Route:**
   - Monitor `/api/upload-via-presigned` - should be minimal
   - Monitor `/api/submit-job` - primary consumer
   - Monitor `/api/get-image-url` - should be cached

3. **R2 Metrics:**
   - Direct upload success rate
   - Download bandwidth (should be minimal)

### Alert Thresholds:

- Fast Origin Transfer > 8 GB = Warning
- Fast Origin Transfer > 9 GB = Critical
- Function duration > 30s average = Investigation needed

## 📝 Testing Checklist

- [x] Upload flow works with presigned URLs
- [x] Image processing still works
- [x] Watermarks display correctly with CSS
- [x] Browser caching works for images
- [x] CDN caching headers applied
- [x] No linter errors
- [ ] Test on production (deploy and monitor)
- [ ] Verify bandwidth reduction in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Load test to ensure performance maintained

---

## 🛠️ Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Upload Issues:** Revert `upload-via-presigned/route.ts` and `page.tsx`
2. **Watermark Issues:** Revert `SecureImagePreview.tsx` (git has old canvas version)
3. **Caching Issues:** Adjust `vercel.json` headers
4. **Processing Issues:** Revert `submit-job/route.ts` timeout changes

All changes are backward compatible except the upload flow change.

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Presigned URLs are powerful** - Eliminate serverless proxying for uploads/downloads
2. **Canvas processing is expensive** - CSS overlays are lighter and cacheable
3. **Timeouts prevent bandwidth waste** - Failed/hanging requests consume bandwidth
4. **Edge > Serverless** - Use Edge runtime when possible for better performance
5. **Caching is critical** - Proper cache headers reduce repeated transfers
