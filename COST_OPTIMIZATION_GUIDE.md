# Vercel Cost Optimization Guide

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the optimizations made to significantly reduce your Vercel bill while maintaining full functionality and UI.

## Major Cost Savings Implemented

### 1. ✅ Removed Image Proxy API Route (BIGGEST SAVINGS)

**Before:**
- Every image request went through `/api/image-proxy`
- Each view triggered a serverless function invocation
- Images were fetched from R2, loaded into memory, and streamed through Vercel
- This caused massive bandwidth and function execution costs

**After:**
- Images are now served directly from Cloudflare R2 CDN
- Zero serverless function invocations for images
- Zero bandwidth costs through Vercel for images
- Cloudflare R2's free tier includes 10 million Class A operations/month

**Estimated Savings:** 80-90% reduction in function invocations and bandwidth costs

### 2. ✅ Disabled Vercel Analytics & Speed Insights

**Before:**
- These paid features added to your monthly bill
- Each page view sent analytics data

**After:**
- Commented out (easy to re-enable if needed)
- You can use free alternatives like Google Analytics or Plausible

**Estimated Savings:** $10-30/month depending on traffic

### 3. ✅ Added Function Duration Limits

**Before:**
- API routes could run indefinitely, potentially causing cost spikes
- No protection against long-running functions

**After:**
- All API routes now have `maxDuration: 60` seconds (Vercel limit)
- Prevents unexpected costs from stuck functions

**Estimated Savings:** Protects against unexpected cost spikes

### 4. ✅ Optimized Caching Headers

**Before:**
- Image cache was only 1 hour
- Frequent revalidation caused more function calls

**After:**
- Increased image cache to 1 year (images are immutable)
- Better CDN efficiency

**Estimated Savings:** Reduced cache misses and function invocations

## Required Configuration

### CRITICAL: Make Your R2 Bucket Publicly Accessible

The biggest optimization (direct R2 serving) requires your R2 bucket to be publicly accessible. Here are two options:

#### Option 1: Enable Public Access on R2 Bucket (Recommended)

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → R2
2. Select your bucket
3. Go to Settings → Public Access
4. Enable "Allow Access" and note the public URL
5. Add this to your `.env` file:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_URL=https://your-public-r2-url.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/your-bucket-name
   ```

#### Option 2: Use R2 Custom Domain with Public Access

1. Go to your R2 bucket settings
2. Set up a custom domain (e.g., `cdn.recolor.example.com`)
3. Configure the domain to allow public access
4. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_URL=https://cdn.recolor.example.com
   ```

### Environment Variable Setup

Add this to your Vercel environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_URL=https://your-r2-public-url
```

**Important:** The URL should NOT include the final file path, just the base URL.

### Fallback Behavior

If `NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_URL` is not set, the app will automatically fall back to the old image-proxy method. However, this defeats the cost optimization, so **make sure to configure it**.

## Expected Cost Reduction

Based on typical usage patterns:

| Cost Category | Before | After | Savings |
|--------------|--------|-------|---------|
| Function Invocations | $50-200/mo | $5-20/mo | 80-90% |
| Bandwidth | $30-100/mo | $2-10/mo | 85-95% |
| Vercel Analytics | $10-30/mo | $0 | 100% |
| **Total Estimated** | **$90-330/mo** | **$7-30/mo** | **85-95%** |

## Verification Steps

After deploying these changes:

1. ✅ Check browser DevTools → Network tab
2. ✅ Image requests should go directly to R2 (not `/api/image-proxy`)
3. ✅ Vercel function logs should show significantly fewer invocations
4. ✅ Monitor your Vercel dashboard for 48 hours to see reduced costs

## What's Still Using Vercel Functions?

These API routes still use serverless functions (as they should):

- `/api/upload-via-presigned` - Handles file uploads (only called once per image)
- `/api/submit-job` - Triggers AI colorization (only called once per image)
- `/api/payments/*` - Payment processing (minimal calls)
- `/api/verify-payment` - Payment verification (one call per payment)

These are essential and low-frequency, so they contribute minimally to costs.

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert these changes:

1. Restore the image-proxy route from git history
2. Uncomment Analytics and SpeedInsights in `layout.tsx`
3. Update `page.tsx` and `payment/success/page.tsx` to use `/api/image-proxy` URLs
4. Redeploy

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Enable Cloudflare CDN Caching
- R2 public URLs automatically benefit from Cloudflare's CDN
- No additional configuration needed

### 2. Monitor Your Costs
- Set up Vercel spending alerts
- Review monthly bills to track improvements

### 3. Consider Image Optimization
- Your Next.js config already uses WebP format ✅
- Images are already lazy-loaded ✅
- Consider reducing image quality slightly if acceptable

### 4. Alternative Analytics
- Google Analytics 4 (free)
- Plausible (privacy-focused, $9/mo)
- Simple Analytics ($19/mo)
- Umami (self-hosted, free)

## Testing Checklist

Before considering this complete, test:

- [ ] Upload an image
- [ ] Preview shows correctly
- [ ] Payment flow works
- [ ] Download HD image works
- [ ] Images load fast
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Vercel function logs show reduced activity

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check Vercel function logs for errors
2. Verify R2 bucket is publicly accessible
3. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_R2_URL` is set correctly
4. Check browser console for CORS errors
5. Test in incognito mode to rule out caching issues

## Summary

These optimizations should reduce your Vercel bill by **80-95%** while maintaining:
- ✅ Same functionality
- ✅ Same UI/UX
- ✅ Same or better performance
- ✅ Same reliability

The main trade-off is that R2 images are now public (but with obscure, unpredictable URLs, providing security through obscurity).
