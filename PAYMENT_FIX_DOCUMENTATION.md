# Payment Issue Fix - Documentation

## Problem Summary

Users reported that they successfully made payments but couldn't download their colorized images. This was a **critical production bug** that affected paying customers.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by a **race condition** in the payment verification flow. There were two separate mechanisms that should mark a job as paid:

1. **PhonePe Webhook** (`/api/payments/webhook`) - Asynchronously marks `job.isPaid = true`
2. **Manual Verification** (`/api/verify-payment`) - Called from the success page to mark `job.isPaid = true`

### The Problem

If **BOTH** mechanisms failed or were delayed:
- ✅ Payment was successful (order status = PAID)
- ❌ Job was NOT marked as paid (`job.isPaid = false`)
- ❌ User couldn't download the image (download API required `isPaid = true`)

### Why This Happened in Production

1. **Webhook Delays/Failures**: PhonePe webhooks can be delayed or lost due to network issues
2. **Silent Error Handling**: The success page silently caught errors from `verify-payment`, assuming the webhook would eventually fix it
3. **No Retry Mechanism**: If both mechanisms failed initially, there was no retry
4. **No User Notification**: Users weren't informed when something went wrong
5. **Strict Download Check**: The download endpoint only checked `job.isPaid` without any fallback

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Payment Success Page (`/app/payment/success/page.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added retry logic for `verify-payment` calls (up to 5 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Added retry logic for fetching image URLs (up to 3 attempts)
- Added user-facing error message when image loading fails
- Added WhatsApp support contact with pre-filled order details

**Benefits:**
- Handles transient network failures automatically
- Gives webhooks more time to arrive
- Provides clear guidance to users if issues persist

### 2. Improved Download Endpoint (`/app/api/download-image/route.ts`)

**Changes:**
- Added fallback check: If `job.isPaid = false`, checks if there's a PAID order for this job
- If found, allows download and asynchronously updates `job.isPaid = true`

**Benefits:**
- Handles race conditions where payment succeeded but job wasn't updated yet
- Self-healing: Automatically fixes the job status when accessed
- Users can download immediately even if the webhook/verify-payment failed

### 3. Robust Verify Payment Endpoint (`/app/api/verify-payment/route.ts`)

**Changes:**
- Added pre-check to verify job exists before updating
- Added order metadata update to ensure jobId is stored
- Improved error handling with specific error codes
- Made the endpoint idempotent (safe to call multiple times)

**Benefits:**
- Better error messages for debugging
- Ensures metadata integrity for future lookups
- Won't fail if called multiple times

### 4. Enhanced Webhook Handler (`/app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts`)

**Changes:**
- Added job existence check before updating
- Added duplicate transaction prevention
- Added comprehensive error logging
- Made job update non-blocking (won't fail webhook if job update fails)

**Benefits:**
- More resilient to edge cases
- Better visibility into issues
- Won't lose payment confirmations due to job update failures

### 5. Admin Fix Endpoint (`/app/api/admin/fix-payment/route.ts`) - NEW

**Purpose:**
Manual intervention tool for customer support to fix stuck payments.

**Features:**
- Fix a specific order by ID
- Bulk fix all eligible orders
- Protected by admin key authentication
- Returns detailed results with errors

**Usage:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/admin/fix-payment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "adminKey": "your-secret-admin-key",
    "orderId": "specific-order-id-optional"
  }'
```

**Setup Required:**
Add to your `.env`:
```
ADMIN_FIX_PAYMENT_KEY=your-secret-random-key-here
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

1. **Happy Path Test:**
   - Upload image
   - Complete payment
   - Verify download works immediately

2. **Webhook Delay Test:**
   - Temporarily disable webhooks
   - Complete payment
   - Verify success page retry logic works
   - Verify download endpoint fallback works

3. **Database Error Test:**
   - Simulate database connection issues
   - Verify user sees helpful error message

4. **Support Flow Test:**
   - Trigger error message
   - Click WhatsApp support link
   - Verify order details are pre-filled

### Monitoring

Add alerts for:
- Failed verify-payment calls
- Missing jobId in order metadata
- Jobs not marked as paid after 5 minutes of order being PAID
- Webhook failures

### Production Validation

After deployment:
1. Monitor error logs for 48 hours
2. Check for any orders with `status=PAID` but `job.isPaid=false`
3. Run the admin fix endpoint to clean up any existing issues:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/admin/fix-payment \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"adminKey": "your-key"}'
   ```

## For Customer Support

### If a User Reports This Issue

1. **Get Information:**
   - Order ID
   - Job ID (if available)
   - Payment screenshot

2. **Check Order Status:**
   - Look up order in database
   - Verify `status = 'PAID'`
   - Check if `job.isPaid = true`

3. **Fix the Issue:**
   
   **Option A: Use Admin Fix Endpoint**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/admin/fix-payment \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "adminKey": "your-secret-key",
       "orderId": "user-order-id"
     }'
   ```

   **Option B: Direct Database Update** (if endpoint unavailable)
   ```sql
   UPDATE jobs 
   SET is_paid = true 
   WHERE id = 'job-id-from-order-metadata';
   ```

4. **Send User New Link:**
   ```
   https://your-domain.com/api/download-image?jobId=<JOB_ID>&type=output
   ```

## Database Queries for Monitoring

### Find Stuck Orders (Need Manual Fix)
```sql
SELECT 
  o.id as order_id,
  o.status as order_status,
  o.metadata->>'jobId' as job_id,
  j.is_paid as job_is_paid,
  o.created_at
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN jobs j ON j.id = (o.metadata->>'jobId')
WHERE o.status = 'PAID' 
  AND (j.is_paid = false OR j.is_paid IS NULL)
  AND o.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC;
```

### Count Successful Payments Today
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as successful_payments
FROM orders 
WHERE status = 'PAID' 
  AND created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE;
```

### Count Issues Today
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as stuck_payments
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN jobs j ON j.id = (o.metadata->>'jobId')
WHERE o.status = 'PAID' 
  AND j.is_paid = false
  AND o.created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE;
```

## Prevention Measures

To prevent this issue from recurring:

1. **Set up monitoring** for the metrics above
2. **Run the admin fix endpoint daily** as a cron job to auto-fix any stuck orders
3. **Monitor webhook delivery** from PhonePe dashboard
4. **Set up alerts** for payment verification failures
5. **Regular database audits** for data consistency
