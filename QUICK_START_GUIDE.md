# Quick Start Guide - Payment Fix Deployment

## ðŸš€ Immediate Setup Required

### 1. Add Environment Variable

Add this to your production environment (Vercel, etc.):

```bash
ADMIN_FIX_PAYMENT_KEY=<generate-secure-random-key>
```

**Generate a secure key:**
```bash
# On Linux/Mac:
openssl rand -base64 32

# Or use any random string generator
# Example: "8xK9mP2vL4nQ6wR3tY7uZ1aB5cD0eF8gH"
```

### 2. Deploy the Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve payment success but image not downloadable issue"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Clean Up Existing Stuck Orders

After deployment, run this once to fix any existing stuck orders:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-production-domain.com/api/admin/fix-payment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "adminKey": "your-actual-admin-key-from-env"
  }'
```

This will scan and fix all orders where payment succeeded but the job wasn't marked as paid.

## ðŸ“Š How to Check for Issues

### Quick Check in Production

Run this in your production database:

```sql
-- Find orders with payment issues
SELECT 
  o.id as order_id,
  o.metadata->>'jobId' as job_id,
  o.created_at
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN jobs j ON j.id = (o.metadata->>'jobId')
WHERE o.status = 'PAID' 
  AND j.is_paid = false
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### If You Find Issues

Fix them immediately with:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/admin/fix-payment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "adminKey": "your-admin-key",
    "orderId": "specific-order-id-from-query"
  }'
```

## ðŸ”§ For Customer Support

### User says: "I paid but can't download my image"

**Quick Fix (3 steps):**

1. **Get their Order ID** (from payment confirmation)

2. **Run the fix command:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/admin/fix-payment \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "adminKey": "your-admin-key",
       "orderId": "their-order-id"
     }'
   ```

3. **Tell them:** "Fixed! Please refresh the page or use this link:"
   ```
   https://your-domain.com/payment/success?order_id=THEIR_ORDER_ID
   ```

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Fixed

The system now has **3 layers of protection**:

1. **Layer 1**: PhonePe webhook marks job as paid âœ…
2. **Layer 2**: Success page retries verify-payment 5 times âœ…
3. **Layer 3**: Download endpoint checks order status as fallback âœ…

Even if Layers 1 & 2 fail, Layer 3 ensures users can still download!

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring (Optional but Recommended)

Set up a daily cron job to auto-fix any stuck orders:

```bash
# Add to crontab:
0 */6 * * * curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/admin/fix-payment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"adminKey": "your-key"}' >> /var/log/payment-fix.log 2>&1
```

This runs every 6 hours and automatically fixes any stuck orders.

## âœ… Verification

After deployment, test the payment flow:

1. Upload an image
2. Complete a test payment
3. Verify you can download immediately
4. Check the order in database to confirm `job.isPaid = true`

## ðŸ†˜ If Something Breaks

All changes are backward compatible. If you need to rollback:

1. The old code will still work
2. But you'll lose the automatic retry and fallback features
3. You can manually fix orders using the database query:
   ```sql
   UPDATE jobs SET is_paid = true 
   WHERE id IN (
     SELECT metadata->>'jobId' FROM orders WHERE status = 'PAID'
   );
   ```
